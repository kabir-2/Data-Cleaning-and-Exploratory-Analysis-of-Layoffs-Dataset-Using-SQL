# Data-Cleaning-and-Exploratory-Analysis-of-Layoffs-Dataset-Using-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a layoffs dataset using SQL. The dataset includes information on layoffs across industries and companies, covering details like affected employees, reasons, industries, and locations.<br>

Objectives:<br>

1. Data Cleaning:<br>

• Handling Null Values: Identify and handle null values appropriately, ensuring data integrity.<br>
• Removing Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate records to maintain dataset accuracy.<br>
• Standardizing Data: Ensure consistency by standardizing formats (e.g., dates, categorical variables).<br>

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>

• Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics to understand the distribution of layoffs.<br>
• Visualization: Create SQL queries to visualize trends in layoffs across industries, locations, and over time.<br>

Tools:<br>

SQL Workbench: For data cleaning, integration, querying, and visualization (if supported).<br><br>
Deliverables:<br>

• Cleaned and standardized SQL dataset.<br>
• EDA report featuring descriptive statistics and visualizations.<br>

Conclusion:<br>

This project aims to leverage SQL for thorough data cleaning and insightful exploratory analysis of layoffs data. By ensuring data quality and exploring trends, it provides valuable insights into workforce dynamics and organizational strategies during periods of layoffs.
